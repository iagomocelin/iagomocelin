- 🙋‍♂️ Hi, I’m Iago Mocelin (17yo). I've recently graduated with a Computer Technician Associate Degree at IFRS (Class of 2021).
- 🏫 I'm now majoring in Biotechnology/Bioinformatics at UFRGS (Class of 2025)
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development with Django! I can do full-stack development but JS isn't really my thing...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP. I'm most advanced with Python and HTML/CSS.
- 🤗 I’m looking forward to collaborate on cool web projects about books or human biology (or anything else, actually)!
- 👨‍🏫 During my internship, I was responsible for a school lab and teaching kids and teenagers the magic of CS
