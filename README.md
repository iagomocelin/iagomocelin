- 🙋‍♂️ Hi, I’m Iago Mocelin (16yo). I'm a high school senior and studying to become an Informatics Technician at IFRS (Class of 2021).
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development with Django! I can do full-stack development but JS isn't really my thing...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP. I'm most advanced with Python and HTML/CSS.
- 🤗 I’m looking forward to collaborate on cool web projects about books or human biology (or anything else, actually)!
- 👨‍🏫 Right now I'm responsible for a school lab and teaching kids and teenagers the magic of CS
- 📫 You can reach me at iago.mocelindasilva@gmail.com or @iagomocelin on Instagram
